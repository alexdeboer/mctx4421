\-The following describes the \-Ro\-B\-I\-O\-S operating system library routines.\par
 \-In application files use\-:\par
 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 #include "eyebot.h"
\end{DoxyCode}
 \-The following libraries are available for programming the \-Beagle\-Board in \-C.\par
 \-In application program, include \char`\"{}eyebot.\-h\char`\"{} and the library will be automatically linked when calling \char`\"{}gcc\char`\"{} (refer to the example makefile provided).\par
 \-Note that there are also a number of libraries available which are not listed here but are included in the \-Eye\-Bot distribution (e.\-g. elaborate image processing library).\par
 \-They can also be linked with an application program. \-Some of the library functions (in gray text) are not finalized yet and they are not included in this distribution.
